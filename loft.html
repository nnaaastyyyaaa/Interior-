      The <b>Industrial style </b> originated in the 1940s in New York, when
      abandoned industrial buildings were converted into residential spaces.
      These large open areas became popular among artists and creative
      professionals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loft interiors are characterized by high ceilings, large windows, exposed
      brick walls, and visible construction elements such as pipes and beams.
      One of the key features of this style is the use of raw materials and an
      <a href="#definition-open-space">open-plan</a> layout.
    </p>
    <p>
      This style is perfect for people who appreciate open-plan spaces and
      authentic <a href="#definition-loft">Loft architecture</a> with raw
      architectural details.

    <h2>Materials commonly used</h2>
    <ul id="materials">
      <li>Brick</li>
      <li>Concrete</li>
      <li>Metal</li>
      <li>Glass</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Advantages of loft</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3><i>Spacious feeling</i></h3>
        <p>
          Loft interiors create a strong sense of openness because they usually
          avoid unnecessary walls and partitions. High ceilings and large
          windows make the space feel much bigger than it actually is.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3><i>Large amount of natural light</i></h3>
        <p>
          One of the main advantages of Loft design is the use of oversized
          windows. Natural light fills the room during the day, reducing the
          need for artificial lighting and creating a bright atmosphere.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3><i>Modern and artistic atmosphere</i></h3>
        <p>
          The combination of brick walls, metal details, and open layouts gives
          the interior a creative and contemporary look. This style is often
          associated with artistic studios and modern urban living.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3><i>Flexibility in layout</i></h3>
        <p>
          Since Loft spaces are typically open-plan, furniture can be arranged
          in different ways depending on personal needs. This makes the interior
          adaptable and functional.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3><i>Unique architectural character</i></h3>
        <p>
          Exposed beams, pipes, and concrete surfaces add individuality to the
          space. Instead of hiding structural elements, Loft style turns them
          into decorative features.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Minimal decoration required</h3>
        <p>
          Because the architecture itself becomes part of the design, there is
          less need for excessive decoration. The raw materials create visual
          interest on their own.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
